# This page will be about me.
Since I want to make it easier for whomever is stalking me, this content will be in English. If you get bored of the amount of "yap" then I'm sorry for you, find someone else to check upon. I am a nerd, corny, and extremely good looking (thanks ladies). I also play guitar, drive a Benz, and am around 6'1 yankee meters in height, to whomever that wants to stand in line. ***There is no line.***

All of this is handwritten, to show off my linguistical skills (jk I just like being myself). I set up for myself this, and the links website, a while ago – though they haven't been in use for a looong time. If I had people around me who actually cared for me — instead of (insert the part where I raged that I removed) — they probably would have asked, “Why do you know so much?” I would have answered, “Because I enjoy learning.” Sadly, reality differs and no one cares about me. (insert that funny picture of the wolf that is popular on tiktok)

Q&A <br>
*Is this cringe?* <br>
Yes, yes it is. <br>

Introduction – lets start with my name. 
Ronî Şikak Mecîd | رۆنی شکاک مەجید | Рони Шькак Мәщид ☀️ In the three alphabets, in use, of Kurdish: Latin/Hawar, Soran, and Cyrillic. Yes, I did in fact teach myself all of them. Feeling useless? We haven't even begun!
## Beginning with the last part first. My tribal name and my surname – related to Mustafa Kemal and İsmail Enver Paşa? Surprisingly, yes!
Kurdish: Mecîd; Ottoman Turkish: مجید
My surname is Ottoman, given as an honorary title. Unlike the meaningless gypsy names most Turks have today that come from the 1934 name reform.

An honorary title given to a (Kurdish: "Şikak") tribal member. 

"Who are the Şikaks", you might ask. I will provide with some context.
The Şikaks are Kurdish tribals who inhabit the modern day regions of Colemêrg/Hakkari and Urmiyê/Urmia, with a significant migrational population to Northern Aleppo/Efrîn. It is one of the five most ancient Kurdish clans, still speaking the native Kurmancî with a majority. Up until and beyond the Armenian genocide, the Şikak clan was ruled by a tribal leader. Its last clan-head being Simko Axa/Agha/Ağa, or Simko of the Şikaks, as was his honorary name by the Ottomans. It was a fighting clan, and allies of the Ottoman Turks. They took up arms against the Azeri Qajars of Iran, the ruling dynasty – with extremely ugly women, I might add. Around the time of the Armenian genocide, Simko Axa took up arms against the Qajars, with an army of 12,000 thousand man strong, most of which were Ottoman mercenaries, being Alevi Turks of majority. He conquered territories, vast. The entirety of the modern province of "Western Azerbaijan" in Iran was conquered within a year, and he was making his way to Tabriz. Mustafa Kemal, İsmail Enver Paşa, and Kâzım Karabekir were the Ottoman generals who were assigned to the Şikak revolt, helping the Kurds against Azeri rule.

The father of my surname, (Kurdish: "Hec Mecîd", transliteration: Hajj Majid). We do not know of his name prior to the reception of the name "Mecîd", one of the many names of the Sunni God, meaning "illustrious." Hec Mecîd traveled to Mecca, obviously, not only because of the prefix "Hec." Through the seed of Hec Mecîd, the Ottoman title has been passed on to me. I'm not ashamed of my surname, to any jew that's chuckling. Goldstein (points and laughs).

## My given name, Ronî, and its meaning. This will be the simpler part of the paragraph. 
My given name (Kurdish: "Ronî"), meaning light and wise/knowledgeable. It was given to me by my mother, may God bless her pure heart.
