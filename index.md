# This page will be about me. 
Introduction – lets start with my name. 
Ronî Şikak Mecîd | رۆنی شکاک مەجید | Рони Шькак Мәщид ☀️ In the three alphabets, in use, of Kurdish: Latin/Hawar, Soran, and Cyrillic.
## Beginning with the last part first. My tribal name and my surname – related to Mustafa Kemal and İsmail Enver Paşa? Surprisingly, yes.
Kurdish: Mecîd; Ottoman Turkish: مجید
My surname is Ottoman, given as an honorary title. Unlike the meaningless gypsy names most Turks have today that come from the 1934 name reform.

An honorary title given to a (Kurdish: "Şikak") tribal member. 

"Who are the Şikaks", you might ask. I will provide with some context.
The Şikaks are Kurdish tribals who inhabit the modern day regions of Colemêrg/Hakkari and Urmiyê/Urmia, with a significant migrational population to Northern Aleppo/Efrîn. It is one of the five most ancient Kurdish clans, still speaking the native Kurmancî with a majority. Up until and beyond the Armenian genocide, the Şikak clan was ruled by a tribal leader. Its last clan-head being Simko Axa/Agha/Ağa, or Simko of the Şikaks, as was his honorary name by the Ottomans. It was a fighting clan, and allies of the Ottoman Turks. They took up arms against the Azeri Qajars of Iran, the ruling dynasty – with extremely ugly women, I might add. Around the time of the Armenian genocide, Simko Axa took up arms against the Qajars, with an army of 12,000 thousand man strong, most of which were Ottoman mercenaries, being Alevi Turks of majority. He conquered territories, vast. The entirety of the modern province of "Western Azerbaijan" in Iran was conquered within a year, and he was making his way to Tabriz. Mustafa Kemal, İsmail Enver Paşa, and Kâzım Karabekir were the Ottoman generals who were assigned to the Şikak revolt, helping the Kurds against Azeri rule.

The father of my surname, (Kurdish: "Hec Mecîd", transliteration: Hajj Majid). We do not know of his name prior to the reception of the prestigious name "Mecîd", one of the many names of the Sunni God, meaning "illustrious." The knowledge of why he earned this title has been lost to history, and what has been passed on to us is of dengbêj. Hec Mecîd traveled to Mecca, obviously, not only because of the prefix "Hec." As a native of Urmiyê, he settled in Efrîn region some time after the defeat of the Şikaks in Western Azerbaijan. The sum of 12,000 troops were massacered, with Alevi Turks making up the majority. Ironic how Azeris and Turks claim brotherhood whilst not too long ago they commited bloody genocides against each other. Through the seed of Hec Mecîd, the Ottoman title has been passed on to me. 

## My given name, Ronî, and its meaning. This will be the simpler part of the paragraph. 
My given name (Kurdish: "Ronî"), meaning light and wise/knowledgeable. It was given to me by my mother, may God bless her pure heart.

## Assimilation
As for the integration of different ethnicities into a particular culture – it's one of the worst corruptions of all. For a man dying with honor to preserve what God gave him, how God made him, is the definitive answer to the question. For God did not strike down those who built the tower of Babel out of comedy. There's a corruption in man which He demolished, and that corruption is what assimilation is trying to revive. Even if we exclude the Biblical answer, what is there for assimilation that independence doesn't solve, that autonomy doesn't solve. For assimilation is not only a subjugation of man, but of an entire kind and culture. If there is no one better than the other, then why proceed with all of this? There will be tribalism, but only out of evil. Adam did not subjugate Eve, neither his own children, but the corruption took on Cain in the presence of his brother Abel. Cain slaying his own brother out of envy, among other beastly traits. What are you that supports all of this, none other than a man with beastly traits. It is for your own benefit that you seek this. 

This does not mean the full isolation of each according to his kind. Rather it is a respect, a covenant between men as was between God and man. We again return to tribalism with those who seek others solely because they're of their own kind. It is for the benefit of the devil. There is no superiority of one over the other.
