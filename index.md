# This page will be about me. 
Introduction – lets start with my name. 
Ronî Şikak Mecîd | رۆنی شکاک مەجید | Рони Шькак Мәщид ☀️ In the three alphabets, in use, of Kurdish: Latin/Hawar, Soran, and Cyrillic.
## Beginning with the last part first. My tribal name and my surname – related to Mustafa Kemal? Surprisingly, yes.
Kurdish: Mecîd; Ottoman Turkish: مجید
My surname is Ottoman, given as an honorary title. Ironically, if I were to introduce myself by my surname, most modern day turks would laugh. It's because of ignorance and racism, obviously. Yet if you point that out, they will pretend to be angels. It's like all of my life experiences with you turks dissappear just because you said so! Most of them bear false, meaningless, and pointless names given after the surname reform in Turkey, in the year 1934. Enough with the venting.

Returning to the surname: an honorary title given to a (Kurdish: "Şikak") tribel member. 

"Who are the Şikaks", you might ask. I will provide with some context.
The Şikaks are Kurdish tribals who inhabit the modern day regions of Colemêrg/Hakkari and Urmiyê/Urmia, with a significant migrational population to Northern Aleppo/Efrîn. It is one of the five most ancient Kurdish clans, still speaking the native Kurmancî with a majority. Up until and beyond the Armenian genocide, the Şikak clan was ruled by a tribal leader. Its last clan-head being Simko Axa/Agha/Ağa, or Simko of the Şikaks, as were his honorary name by the Ottomans. It was a fighting clan, and allies of the Ottoman Turks. They took up arms against the Azeri Qajars of Iran, the ruling dynasty – with extremely ugly women, I might add. Around the time of the Armenian genocide, Simko Axa took up arms against the Qajars, with an army of 12,000 thousand man strong, most of which were Ottoman mercenaries being Alevi Turks of majority. He conquered territories, vast. The entirety of the modern province of "Western Azerbaijan" in Iran was conquered within a year, and he was making his way to Tabriz. Mustafa Kemal was the Ottoman general who was assigned to the Şikak revolt, helping the Kurds against Azeri rule. 

The father of my surname, (Kurdish: "Hec Mecîd", transliteration: Hajj Majid). We do not know of his name prior to the reception of the prestigious name "Mecîd", one of the many names of the Sunni God, meaning "illustrious." The knowledge of why he earned this title has been lost to history, and what has been passed on to us is of dengbêj. Hec Mecîd traveled to Mecca, obviously, not only because of the prefix "Hec." As a native of Urmiyê, he settled in Efrîn region some time after the defeat of the Şikaks in Western Azerbaijan. The sum of 12,000 troops were massacered, with Alevi Turks making up the majority. Ironic how Azeris and Turks claim brotherhood whilst not too long ago they commited bloody genocides against each other. Through the seed of Hec Mecîd, the Ottoman title has been passed on to me. 

## My given name, Ronî, and its meaning. This will be the simpler part of the paragraph. 
My given name (Kurdish: "Ronî"), meaning light and wise/knowledgeable. It was given to me by my mother, may God bless her pure heart.
