# Sub-humanism of modern man
Prior to starting this paragraph, I want to confess my sins. I want to confess that this is a wrong-doing. I know that coming to this conclusion is a result of corruption on my part. There is a lot to be said about this, but I will leave it for another time.

**Expectations of superiority in man, and the results thereof** <br> This is an active project, it is not finished. <br> September 4th, Thursday night. <br>

Expectations are human, there are a plethora – many types of expectations exist. I will start off with talking about the expectations of superiority, and I’ll see how this veers. 

Modern man, when he sees someone who is above him, he doubts, not himself but rather that the superiority of the subject exists. The thought that his personal accomplishments or worth lacks in comparison to the subject does subconsciously cross his mind. Indeed, what he consciously chooses to believe, rather what conclusion he comes to, is that it simply cannot be true. His primitivity does not allow him to subject himself to humility in what he deems to be competition. Note that this could just be his state in a simple conversation. He doubts until proven otherwise, even if the subject does not find the necessity to prove anything. The state of denial can differ. Some stay in the state of denial, in my experience this commonly occurs in women – they will view superiority in any case, even when they know that it is not true. When man is proven otherwise, several different reactions could follow. Commonly, envy and anger pursue. He will try to prove himself, to the subject, to those around him, and even to himself as to acquire reassurance in his thought of belief of dominance. He becomes primal, and lashes out, like the animal that he is. He will lie, he will project. In his mind, a declaration of war on the subject, and all that the subject is and provides. He will think of ways, any way, to instill corruption. He will even result to harming himself if he sees that it also causes harm to the subject. 

The subject, if Christian, will not need to prove any superiority. In the essence of humility, a Christian will choose to be inferior, even if there is nothing that suggests that it is the case. The Christian, even in struggle, will not react to his primal instincts, because he is made in the image of God. Not filthed up, not oxidized – the grade differs in individuals. The submission to God demands a pure state of self, to exercise His energies, and to take part of what is holy. Purity comes from God and the morality He has set, the law which He hath engraved. Man loses this in the duration of his life, unless he chooseth to submit. 

 **Lying in a synthetic position of superiority and baseless belief of understanding above the subject.** <br> This is an active project, it is not finished. <br> September 5th, Friday noon.

As the phenomenon in the prior paragraph mostly occurs in men, this particularly is something I mostly see in women. Also prevalent in high estrogen men, though it is much less common. <br>

Lying, whether to protect oneself, ones understanding, ones position or decision. It is a common phenomena, which occurs mostly when the woman in question believes that her authority or understanding is above the man, the subject, which she is opposing. The opposition of the woman, in most cases, is fueled by emotions, as most encounters with the common woman. <br>

This role can of course apply to any gender – since I, a male, encounter this with women – I will write out of my common perspective. <br>

The woman has the belief that telling the lie is straightforward, and fails to consider anything else. Seriously, a dense position, which mostly is synthesized out of desperation, whether the desperation is justified or not. Most men fight this, spend their energy, a currency, on a decision set in stone. The woman can change her mind, more often than a man does. Yet, if she chose confrontation, the woman in question has been thinking about the subject-matter prior to it. The likeliness for the opposing position to take seed in her mind is much unlikely. 

*The meeting of minds is possible, but certain personality traits can affect this.*

When the subject chooseth to submit to the decision, i.e. the will of the woman, no matter his position or understanding of the subject-matter – the woman will assume lower intelligence of the subject and that the man cannot provide the security and guidance she needs, almost always subconsciously in my experience. This will cause her to have confidence in her decision in the near future. The woman is emotional and reflective, she doesn't necessarily stick to her own decisions in or for the long-term. In any case, the disrespect of the fellowman, the subject, might be a common theme in the relationship going forth. 

Yet, acting in hardheartedness, in opposition, doesn’t grant any favors either, she will assume that you’re dull, and fail to understand what she has to say. Inconsiderate in other words, among other things. Revealing your understanding of the situation will lead her to lie more. There is no achievement to acquire in the case of the subject, you will lose. <br>

Dishonesty, like any sin, has consequences, and the lost generation fails to consider this. They live out of their own understanding, and refuse to submit to the Truth. The Christian will not fight in this confrontation, a childish fight. In my case, it was and is difficult to let go of the people which riseded in my love. You want to help them, you want to be there for them, it is a Christian fruit to be selfless. Yet, what the Lord wills happens no matter ones own understanding of the situation. God knows whether they are hurting themselves or not. It is not up to the Christian to oppose the will of God, no creation should question his Creator. أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ

# Future projects

**Obsession** 
Obsession is a word thrown around a lot, but in reality there is a true strict definition. I’m not here to explain the word, you are welcome to look for it yourself. This is a very broad topic, but I will write about the obsession of men in women.

The state of mind of a man that obsesses over a woman. Commonly there are two roots. I will only dive into these, and only surface level. This is not about men with mental issues. 
*I might do more, or change some things up. I'll see what experiences catch my attention.*

The state of turbulence, and hypoestrogenism.
