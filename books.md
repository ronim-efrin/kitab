# Here I will post the books I have read, am reading, or want to read...

Sometimes it can be difficult to keep track of what you have and haven't done. Then there is the bragging factor as well; however, I don't think my ignorant generation cares too much. I shouldn't be proud either - I hardly read really. Many of these books I have read because of school, but only in Swedish - those in English I've read myself. Though, I still tell myself that hardly reading is better than not reading **at all**.

I will miss many books, I am not exactly an archive. I archive what I remember reading. I have read some Kurdish books that I have forgotten the names of, but it would not have helped much as they are probably very difficult to Google. I will also progressively add new books which I've read. *duh* 

Don't get any ideas of why I want to read sertain political books, if you're curious - then just ask me. The short answer is that I want to know how these great men thought, the best way to get to know is to get to know them - by reading their books!
