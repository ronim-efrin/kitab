# Sub-humanism of modern man
This is an active project, it is not finished. 
September 4th, Thursday night. 

Prior to starting this paragraph, I want to confess my sins. I want to confess that this is a wrong-doing. I know that coming to this conclusion is a result of corruption on my part.

**Expectations of superiority in man, and the results thereof** <br>
Expectations are human, there are a plethora – many types of expectations exist. I will start off with talking about the expectations of superiority, and I’ll see how this veers. 

Modern man, when he sees someone who is above him, he doubts, not himself but rather that the superiority of the subject exists. The thought that his personal accomplishments or worth lacks in comparison to the subject does subconsciously cross his mind. Indeed, what he consciously chooses to believe, rather what conclusion he comes to, is that it simply cannot be true. His primitivity does not allow him to subject himself to humility in what he deems to be competition. Note that this could just be his state in a simple conversation. He doubts until proven otherwise, even if the subject does not find the necessity to prove anything. The state of denial can differ. Some stay in the state of denial, in my experience this commonly occurs in women – they will view superiority in any case, even when they know that it is not true. When man is proven otherwise, several different reactions could follow. Commonly, envy and anger pursue. He will try to prove himself, to the subject, to those around him, and even to himself as to acquire reassurance in his thought of belief of dominance. He becomes primal, and lashes out, like the animal that he is. He will lie, he will project. In his mind, a declaration of war on the subject, and all that the subject is and provides. He will think of ways, any way, to instill corruption. He will even result to harming himself if he sees that it also causes harm for the subject. 

The subject, if Christian, will not need to prove any superiority. In the essence of humility, a Christian will choose to be inferior, even if there is nothing that suggests that it is the case. The Christian, even in struggle, will not react to his primal instincts, because he is made in the image of God. Not filthed up, not oxidized – the grade differs in individuals. The submission to God demands a pure state of self, to exercise His energies, and to take part of what is holy. Purity comes from God and the morality He has set, the law which He hath engraved. Man loses this in the duration of his life, unless he chooseth to submit.
