I'm eating tacos rn, I'll see what purpose this page will serve later. 

Seeing right through people is a trait, a gift, I am very thankful to have. Praise God. I get to analyze people in a way that could take others years. No assumptions, no delusions, a slight judgement. Yes, what I say is not what I think, it will never be. Because, truly, I will never share my mind with anyone. Even the things I might say sometimes I myself don’t believe, because I know it will serve a purpose.

No one knows me, not even the guy that was supposed to be my best friend. Yet, it felt like she was the person that could see through me. Did I imagine, was it my imagination? People are stupid, no matter how much time you give them. But her? I didn’t know her, she didn’t know me. Why does she know? Why does she know what I am? Why does she know what I am thinking? What I am feeling?

She was a log, a complete stock, dull, when writing to me on messages. Her assumptions were completely retarded. Unironically looking back at it, I shouldn’t been that active on WhatsApp. Obviously I overlooked all of it, I don’t get hurt by stupidity. (Sorry) 

But in person? The person I interacted with? It was almost dreamy. Obviously good things don’t last, but in the last moments of respect, when she still cared, before she turned into plastic, there was this shared shyness between me and her. Like both were scared to see it go, yet couldn’t take it further. I am not shy, I am quiet in obedience to God. But this time… I was. Mind you it was an average day, she was just studying. I found beauty in that, in something so little, small, minute, yet meant so much. It wouldn't surprise me if there was an unshared reaction of hers.

She hugged me twice that day, and I never saw that person ever again after that. 

Eh, no matter, men don’t surrender to their feelings. I’m happy to let go, but it had potential. 
<br>May God’s will be done.
