# **Psalm 50** *(good everyday psalm for repentance)*
<br>1 For the end, a Psalm of David, 
<br>2 when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to Bersabee.
<br>3 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my transgression. 
<br>4 Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
<br>5 For I am conscious of mine iniquity; and my sin is continually before me. 
<br>6 Against thee only have I sinned, and done evil before thee: that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. 
<br>7 For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me.
<br>8 For, behold, thou lovest truth: thou hast manifested to me the secret and hidden things of thy wisdom. 
<br>9 Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be purified: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. 
<br>10 Thou shalt cause me to hear gladness and joy: the afflicted bones shall rejoice. 
<br>11 Turn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
<br>12 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts. 
<br>13 Cast me not away from thy presence; and remove not thy Holy Spirit from me. 
<br>14 Restore to me the joy of thy salvation: establish me with thy *directing Spirit.
<br>15 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and ungodly men shall turn to thee. 
<br>16 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation: and my tongue shall joyfully declare thy righteousness. 
<br>17 O Lord, thou shalt open my lips; and my mouth shall declare thy praise. 
<br>18 For if thou desiredst sacrifice, I would have given it: thou wilt not take pleasure in whole-burnt-offerings. 
<br>19 Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart God will not despise.
<br>20 Do good, O Lord, to Sion in thy good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be built. 
<br>21 Then shalt thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, †offering, and whole-burnt-sacrifices: then shall they offer calves upon thine altar.

# **Psalm 90** *(song for praise and protection)*
<br>1 Praise of a Song, by David. He that dwells in the help of the Highest, shall sojourn under the shelter of the God of heaven. 
<br>2 He shall say to the Lord, Thou art my helper and my refuge: my God; I will hope in him. 
<br>3 For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters, from every troublesome matter. 
<br>4 He shall overshadow thee with his shoulders, and thou shalt trust under his wings: his truth shall cover thee with a shield. 
<br>5 Thou shalt not be afraid of terror by night; nor of the arrow flying by day; 
<br>6 nor of the evil *thing that walks in darkness; nor of calamity, and the evil spirit at noon-day. 
<br>7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. 
<br>8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou observe and see the reward of sinners.
<br>9 For thou, O Lord, art my hope: thou, my soul, hast made the Most High thy refuge. 
<br>10 No evils shall come upon thee, and no scourge shall draw nigh to thy dwelling. 
<br>11 For he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 
<br>12 They shall bear thee up on their hands, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
<br>13 Thou shalt tread on the asp and basilisk: and thou shalt trample on the lion and dragon.
<br>14 For he has hoped in me, and I will deliver him: I will protect him, because he has known my name. 
<br>15 He shall call upon me, and I will hearken to him: I am with him in affliction; and I will deliver him, and glorify him. 
<br>16 I will satisfy him with length of days, and shew him my salvation.

# **Psalm 5** *(song for protection, obedience, and praise)*
<br>1 For the end, a Psalm of David, concerning her that inherits.
<br>2 Hearken to my words, O Lord, *attend to my cry. 
<br>3 Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God: for to thee, O Lord, will I pray. 
<br>4 In the morning thou shalt hear my voice: in the morning will I wait upon thee, and will look up. 
<br>5 For thou art not a God that desires iniquity; neither shall the worker of wickedness dwell with thee. 
<br>6 Neither shall the transgressors continue in thy sight: thou hatest, O Lord, all them that work iniquity. 
<br>7 Thou wilt destroy all that speak falsehood: the Lord abhors the bloody and deceitful man. 
<br>8 But I will enter into thine house in the multitude of thy mercy: I will worship in thy fear toward thy holy temple.
<br>9 Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make my way plain before thy face. 
<br>10 For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit. 
<br>11 Judge them, O God; let them fail of their counsels: cast them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; for they have provoked thee, O Lord.
<br>12 But let all that trust on thee be glad in thee: they shall exult for ever, and thou shalt dwell among them; and all that love thy name shall rejoice in thee. 
<br>13 For thou, Lord, shalt bless the righteous: thou hast ‡compassed us as with a shield of favour.

# **Psalm 22** *(golden psalm for anxiety)*
<br>1 A Psalm of David. The Lord tends me as a shepherd, and I shall want nothing. 
<br>2 In a place of green grass, there he has made me dwell: he has nourished me by the water of rest. 
<br>3 He has restored my soul: he has guided me into the paths of righteousness, for his name's sake. 
<br>4 Yea, even if I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will not be afraid of evils: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, these have comforted me. 
<br>5 Thou hast prepared a table before me in presence of them that afflict me: thou hast thoroughly anointed my head with oil; and thy cup cheers me like the best wine. 
<br>6 Thy mercy also shall follow me all the days of my life: and my dwelling shall be in the house of the Lord for a very long time.


# **Psalm 39** *(help out of the pit of misery, and in the counsel of the wicked)*
<br>1 For the end, a Psalm of David.
<br>2 I waited patiently for the Lord; and he attended to me, and hearkened to my supplication. 
<br>3 And he brought me up out of a pit of misery, and from miry clay: and he set my feet on a rock, and ordered my goings aright. 
<br>4 And he put a new song into my mouth, even a hymn to our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall hope in the Lord. 
<br>5 Blessed is the man whose hope is the name of the Lord, and who has not regarded vanities and false frenzies.
<br>6 O Lord my God, thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, and in thy thoughts there is none who shall be likened to thee: I declared and spoke of them: they exceeded number. 
<br>7 Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not; but a body hast thou prepared me: whole-burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin thou didst not require.
<br>8 Then I said, Behold, I *come: in the volume of the book it is written concerning me, 
<br>9 I desired to do thy will, O my God, and thy law in the midst of mine heart. 
<br>10 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; lo! I will not refrain my lips; O Lord, thou knowest my righteousness. 
<br>11 I have not hid thy truth within my heart, and I have declared thy salvation; I have not hid thy mercy and thy truth from the great congregation.
<br>12 But thou, Lord, remove not thy compassion far from me; thy mercy and thy truth have helped me continually. 
<br>13 For innumerable evils have encompassed me; my transgressions have taken hold of me, and I could not see; they are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; and my heart has failed me. 
<br>14 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, draw nigh to help me. 
<br>15 Let those that seek my soul, to destroy it, be ashamed and confounded together; let those that wish me evil be turned backward and put to shame. 
<br>16 Let those that say to me, Aha, aha, quickly receive shame for their reward. 
<br>17 Let all those that seek thee, O Lord, exult and rejoice in thee; and let them that love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified. 
<br>18 But I am poor and needy; the Lord will take care of me; thou art my helper, and my defender, O my God, delay not.
